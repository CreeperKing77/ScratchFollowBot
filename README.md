Scratch Bot made to follow users on scratch automatically

Uses TimMcCool's scratchattach module

The Bot will give the you two options, into which you will type "1" or "2". 1 will ask you to input a starting user's name, while 2 will just put the bot on standby to check messages.

Please not that follow bots are not allowed on Scratch and use of this program may result in a ban. For this reason testing of new features and bug fixes may come slowly.
